## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

VXLverse employs a sophisticated component-based architecture built with React and TypeScript:

```
VXLverse/
├── Editor/                # Main workspace components
│   ├── ScenePanel         # Hierarchy and object management
│   ├── PropertiesPanel    # Object configuration interface
│   ├── EditorScene        # 3D rendering environment
│   └── ToolsPanel         # Creation and manipulation tools
├── Game/                  # In-game components
│   ├── GameHUD            # Pixel-art style interface
│   ├── DialogueModal      # AI-powered conversation system
│   ├── CombatSystem       # Fighting mechanics and projectiles
│   ├── QuestManager       # Quest tracking and rewards
│   └── Inventory          # Item management system
├── AI/                    # AI integration components
│   ├── MistralService     # LLM API communication layer
│   ├── ConversationManager# Dialogue history and context handling
│   └── CharacterMemory    # Persistent NPC memory system
└── Stores/                # State management
    ├── editorStore.ts     # Editor state container
    ├── gameStore.ts       # Game runtime state
    └── userStore.ts       # User preferences and authentication
```

The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns, with dedicated modules for editor functionality, game systems, and AI integration. State management is handled through Zustand stores, providing efficient state updates and persistence with minimal re-renders.
